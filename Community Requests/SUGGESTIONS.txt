I'm pretty heavily visually impaired (registered blind), and currently rely on the in-built full-screen zoom feature in Windows and macOS to allow me to do my work. It's really annoying because currently I'm having to use xmonad inside of a VMWare vm on my PC, which is just a huge waste of hardware resources, just to allow me to Super,+ and Super,- to zoom in.
I've done a fair bit of research and haven't been able to find any way of implementing this myself, but then again, I'm fairly new to configuring wms. If this a feature you could implement, you have me as a long term user!
=========================

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/instantOS/instantARCH/master/topinstall.sh enable user prompts to install the default settings like lightdm, mirrors, timezone, for a vanilla install or to leave those settings unchanged for an existing system looking to install instantWM

Give instantOS bot a profile picture

Have an option to change the positioning of the status bar?

have meta + PrtSc do import -window root ~/Pictures/Screenshots/"$(date)".png
have alt + PrtSc do import -window $(xdotool getmouselocation --shell | grep WINDOW | awk -F "=" '{print $2}') ~/Pictures/Screenshots/"$(date)".png
=========================

Central theming app that allows people to upload and load rises of instant OS
=========================

Is it possible to make the mousewheel scroll feature that activates tmux's prefix+[ scoll compatible with vim's scroll?
=========================

Maybe add this to the distribution by default : Adobe Source Han fonts - Large collection of fonts which comprehensively support Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, with a consistent design and look.
=========================

I just saw that new settings menu, Definitely add a setting to change the time zone, and maybe copy the settings from the gnome settings app, since that is more complete.
=========================

suggestion: est time to 100% charge, and est time to discharge for the battery
=========================

I've been wanting to introduce clickable widgets for a while, but that will still take a bit
But when I do that, a battery widget will certainly be one of them
=========================

allow the user to paste text into the super+a+j+t spam box with ctrl+shift+v
