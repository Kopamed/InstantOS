some sort of error with the instantos oh-my-zsh theme prompt:
(the prompt_git:1: stuff isn't being printed by a command; it's being printed by the zsh theme)
repro steps:
1) open terminal
2) type kill<SPACE><TAB><ENTER>
3) notice the errors
I'm not good enough with zsh scripting to know how to fix this
but I know the errors are coming from the functions in ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/instantos.zsh-theme
